# Minute Quiz

### Description

A simple quiz game I spent time with to play with web technologies. Inspired by one of my favorite mobile games.


### The Game

The game is relatively simple. You are given a category and a letter, you have to guess a word that start with the letter and fits the category. Oh, and you're under time pressure.

Here's a preview:

### Notes

The project is in its early stage, and yeah I know the design sucks; I tried my best CSS capabilities as of the project's writing. I'm still thinking of improving this in the future. Feel free to make modifications I would love to hear any feedback.
