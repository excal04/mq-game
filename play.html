<!-- main game page -->

<!-- TODO:
    * Upon page load, there should be some kind of umm divs that show "ready" "set" "start!"
    and then after that show the first 'card' in a nice transition.

    * make questions appear in a form of a card, so that every next question will look like
    flipping the card (probably slideUp() or slideDown()) in a fast motion (so not to intervere with the timer)
        + If i were to do this, I would use jquery but I think there's a cleaner css way
        that makes it easier with just toggling a class

    * proper positioning of UI components

    * startgame button should not be in this page, should be in the main one :P
